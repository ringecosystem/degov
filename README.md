# DeGov.AI

DeGov.AI is an open-source, on-chain governance platform built for DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem. It leverages the [Governor Framework from OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance) to deliver a robust, flexible, and transparent governance solution for decentralized organizations. See the [demo](https://demo.degov.ai/) for details.

## Features

- **Open**: Free and open-source, allowing anyone to set up their DAO's governance.
- **OpenZeppelin Integration**: Uses OpenZeppelin's governor contracts for a reliable governance foundation.
- **On-chain Governance**: Executes all actions on-chain for transparency and security.
- **AI Powered (Planned in the next milestone)**: Utilizes AI technology for improved governance decisions and recommendations.
## Setting Up Your DeGov Instance

The easiest way to deploy your own DeGov instance is by using the [DeGov Launcher](https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov-launcher). This tool simplifies the setup process, allowing you to quickly configure and launch your governance platform.
